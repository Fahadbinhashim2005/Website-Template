The success of these films is not just a result of innovative directors but also the rapid growth of Indian VFX studios. Studios like Makuta VFX, which worked on RRR, and DNEG, involved in Brahmāstra, are leading the charge in pushing the envelope of what Indian cinema can achieve with visual effects.For instance, DNEG, a global VFX giant with a significant presence in India, has worked on several Hollywood blockbusters, including Dune (2021) and Tenet (2020).

 Perhaps the most significant recent example of VFX in Malayalam cinema is Minnal Murali, a superhero film directed by Basil Joseph. The film’s story required extensive visual effects to depict the protagonist’s superpowers, and the VFX work was widely acclaimed. Minnal Murali set a new standard for what Malayalam cinema could achieve with visual effects, and its success both in India and internationally underscored the growing importance of VFX in the industry.

# Conclusion: VFX as the Future of Indian Cinema

The rise of VFX in the Indian film industry is not just a trend but a transformation that is here to stay. Recent films like Brahmāstra, Kalki 2898 AD, and RRR have demonstrated the power of visual effects in creating immersive cinematic experiences that captivate audiences both in India and around the world. As Indian VFX studios continue to grow and as more filmmakers embrace this technology, the future of Indian cinema looks set to be more dynamic and visually stunning than ever before.
